# School List It Help

You've come to the right place to give feedback on SchooListIt features and user interface. Thank you for using SchooListIt and caring enough to share your thoughts. 

## Visit the Issues Tab, open a new issue, label it
Issues on SchooListIt should be labeled either as a bug or a feature request. Someone from the development team will respond with comments and progress reports or to close the issue. 

## Contribute with code, wiki, marketing, or legal
As you can see, this is not the code repository. We are however open to contributors. In particular, we are seeking assistance within the following areas:
- documentation: official wiki documetation for the app
- marketing: copy, blogging, how-to videos to post on SchooListIt.com
- legal: privacy policies, user agreements, etc.

### Contributing Process
- visit issues tab
- **sort by recently updated**
- choose a good first bug
- ping me if you have questions
- branch
- pull request

*It is important to sort by recently updated because many of these tickets are older and I have moved on from that idea as the system has matured.*
